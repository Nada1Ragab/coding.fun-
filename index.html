<h1 style ="color:blue;"> Coding Is Fun </h1>
<p> The definition of coding is the process of creating instructions for computers using programming languages </p>
<p> Computer code is used to program the websites, apps, and other technologies we interact with every day </p>
<p> Coding is a fun way to learn especially for the new generation, because we are living in technology days </p>
<p> in my point of view every kid should learn coding because it would help him with his future generation as a job and information</p>

<P> Coding is not hard to learn. If you take the time and have a lot of patience, you can really learn just about anything.  Learning to code takes a good amount of time and persistence, but if you have those then I guarantee you'll get there </p>
<p>
There are four types of coding:
<li>Data compression</li>
<li> source coding </li>
<li>Error control</li>
<li> channel coding</li>
<li>Cryptographic coding</li>
<li>Line coding</li>
